        Args:
            browser: Browser to impersonate (`"chrome"` or `"firefox"`).

                If this is `None` (default), no impersonation is performed.
            http3:

                If set to `True`, Impit will try to connect to the target servers using HTTP/3 protocol (if supported by the server).

                .. note::
                    The HTTP/3 support is experimental and may not work with all servers. The impersonation capabilities are limited when using HTTP/3.

                This can be an HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy.

                    Not supported when HTTP/3 is enabled.
            timeout:
                Default request timeout in seconds. Pass ``None`` to disable the timeout entirely.

                This value can be overridden for individual requests.
            verify:
                If set to `False`, impit will not verify SSL certificates.

                This can be used to ignore TLS errors (e.g., self-signed certificates).

                True by default.
            default_encoding:
                Default encoding for response.text field (e.g., "utf-8", "cp1252").

                Overrides `content-type` headers and bytestream prescan.
            follow_redirects:

                If set to `True` the client will automatically follow HTTP redirects (3xx responses).

                `False` by default.
            max_redirects:

                Maximum number of redirects to follow if the `follow_redirects` option is enabled.

                Default is 20.
            cookie_jar:

                Cookie jar to store cookies in.

                This is a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance.

                By default, :class:`Client` doesn't store cookies between requests.
            cookies: httpx-compatible cookies object.

                These are the cookies to include in all requests (to the matching servers) made by this client.

                These headers will be included in all requests made by this client.
                They override any browser impersonation headers (set via the ``browser`` parameter)
                and are in turn overridden by request-specific headers.
                Header matching is case-insensitive — e.g., setting ``user-agent`` here will
                override the impersonation ``User-Agent`` header.

                Default is an empty dictionary.
            local_address:

                Local address to bind the client to.

                Useful for testing purposes or when you want to bind the client to a specific network interface.
                Can be an IP address in the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (for IPv4) or `ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` (for IPv6).
